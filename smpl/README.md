Converting the 3D skeleton keypoints and RGBD point cloud to the skinned model of human

## Components

[complete here]


## Usage


## TODO

1. ~~Feature: Automate point cloud registeration~~
1. ~~Feature: Combine the RGBD point cloud from all cameras~~
1. Feature: Automate or make it easier to register pointclouds
1. Feature: Extract each person's point cloud separately
1. Feature: Align pointclouds and 3D skeletons


## Known issues

1. ~~Point clouds seems not matching perfectly with each other~~
1. Giving the output of the manual registeration as its input doesn't create the same rotation and transition.
