# Skeleton extraction 2D and 3D

Scripts to extract 2D skeletons and project them to 3D world coordinates using depth data and triangulation.

## Components


## Setup


## Usage


## TODO

1. Feature: Introduce triangulation to improve the accuracy of keypoints.
1. Feature: Create 3D point cloud using the multi-camera depth images.
1. Feature: Evaluate the accuracy of openpose skeleton detection as well.
1. Feature: We need explicit tracking of each person.
1. Feature: Normalize the 3D coordinates
1. Feature: Separate the the skeleton extraction from skeleton animation
